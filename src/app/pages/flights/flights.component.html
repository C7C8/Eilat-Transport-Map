    <h3>Air Transport to Eilat</h3>
    <p>Eilat sees many flights come in per day through three separate airports: Eilat Airport, Ramon Airport,
      and Ovda Airport.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.iaa.gov.il/en-US/airports/eilatn/Pages/default.aspx">Eilat Airport</a> is a small airport
      close to the center of the city, with one small runway and ramp space for only two aircraft. The airport
      handles mostly regional flights from other airports in Israel, with
      <a href="http://www.iaa.gov.il/en-US/airports/ovda/Pages/default.aspx">Ovda Airport</a> handling most international
      flights. Ovda is technically a military airbase, but it handles civilian air traffic since larger aircraft on
      international flights can't land on Eilat's runway.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.ramon-airport.com/">Ramon Airport</a> was built to address various concerns,
      such as opening land up in Eilat for further development, decreasing reliance on Ovda Airport,
      handling more air traffic, and so on. The airport opened January 2019 and can handle 2 million
      passengers per year (~66% of Eilat's yearly tourist traffic) but will later be expanded to accommodate
      4 million/year. Eilat Airport is expected to shut down March 2019, and Ovda is expected to stop
      handling civilian traffic.</p>

    <h3>Air Traffic</h3>
    <p>The table on the right shows up to 250 flights that <em>arrived</em> at any of the three airports,
      along with where they came from in order to get a better idea of where most air traffic is coming
      from.</p>

    <h3>When do flights arrive?</h3>
    The bar chart on the left shows when flights are most likely to arrive; that is, a bigger bar
    means that in the past flights have tended to arrive more often at that time than others. Since
    each flight typically brings hundreds of passengers, this information is useful for planning
    transportation offerings.
