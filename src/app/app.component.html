      <h3>Roadmap view</h3>
      <p>Displayed is a roadmap view of Eilat, with all roads shown clearly, and bodies of water in blue. </p>

      <p *ngIf="mapType === 'terrain'">The terrain of the city is shown using shadows and standard topographical
      mapping techniques, to help aid understanding of how terrain affects transport in the city. If you've never
      read a topographical map before, <a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/topo-maps-how-to-use.html">
          here's a quick guide.
